ANKIALE -- ANalysis of Klimate with bayesian Inference: AppLication to extreme
Events -- is a program for the inference, analysis and attribution of extreme
events. The methodology is as follows:

- Inference of the law (which can be specified) for several climate models,
- Estimation of a multi-model synthesis,
- The synthesis is considered as a prior of reality, and the observations are
  used to derive the posterior using Bayesian methods.

These different steps can be called up from the command line. Attributions and
analyses of the inferred laws can then be performed.
